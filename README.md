# CMPT733-Fish-Activity-Detection
This project aims to predict fishing activity using our trained model from several known parameters including the sailing pattern of fishing vessels, location of the vessel, and fishing boundaries. From our prediction, we will be able to isolate vessels which display fishing activity but are not registered as an active fishing vessel. Researchers can furtheruse real-time satellite images/ AIS data as input to our trained model to classify vessel typeand identify potential illegal fishing activity, which would help protect the endangeredspecies.
